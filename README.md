# Paper Trading Agent

A paper-trading decision-support agent, built in phases to learn backend
API development, real database work, LLM fine-tuning, agentic
orchestration, containerized deployment, and cloud deployment — end to
end, on one real system rather than six disconnected exercises.

**Paper trading only.** This project never touches real capital or a live
brokerage account. The goal is an honestly evaluated system, not a claim
of profitability — if backtesting shows no edge, that is the correct,
reportable outcome.

## Status

Phase 01 (Control API) — in progress.

## Roadmap

**V1 — daily decision-support agent**

1. Control API — FastAPI endpoints for positions/decisions/trigger-run *(this phase)*
2. State & history — Postgres schema (watchlist, price snapshots, decisions, outcomes)
3. Decision agent — LangGraph flow: fetch → technicals → sentiment → decide → paper-trade → log
4. Sentiment model — LoRA fine-tune on financial headlines (Hugging Face PEFT)
5. Build pipeline — Dockerfile + GitHub Actions
6. Scheduled run — deployed on AWS (EC2 + RDS), triggered once per session

**Gate:** V1 must be deployed and running end-to-end on paper, and the
strategy logic must be honestly backtested (realistic slippage/commissions,
walk-forward validation), before V2 begins.

**V2 — continuous intraday extension** (each block upgrades a specific V1 block)

7. Live feed — WebSocket market data (e.g. Alpaca paper trading), replacing the daily fetch
8. Hot state — Redis + a queue decoupling the feed from the decision loop
9. Continuous loop — the same agent logic as a long-running worker reacting per bar
10. Risk guardrails — max position size, daily loss limit, stale-data circuit breaker
11. Ops watch — crash/staleness alerting
12. Session scheduler — market-open/close aware, skips weekends/holidays

## Phase 01 — Control API

FastAPI service with four endpoints, backed by an in-memory stub store
(no database yet — that's Phase 02). The stub store exists behind a
`get_store()` dependency so Phase 02 only has to change `app/store.py`,
not the route handlers.

### Endpoints

- `GET /health` — liveness check
- `GET /positions` — open paper positions (optional `?symbol=`)
- `GET /decisions` — decision log, most recent first (optional `?symbol=`, `?limit=`)
- `POST /run/trigger` — run one (stubbed) agent decision cycle

### Run it

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for the interactive API docs.

### Test it

```bash
pytest -q
```
